# tact

A Telegram bot that provides access to Claude Code as a personal assistant. Run Claude Code in any directory and interact with it through Telegram.

## Features

- Chat with Claude Code via Telegram
- Send images and documents for analysis
- **Voice message support** with local Whisper transcription
- **File sending** - Claude can send files back to you
- **Deep reasoning** - `/think` command triggers two-phase analysis with peer review
- Persistent conversation sessions per user
- Configurable Claude settings per project
- Multi-user support with access control

## How It Works

This bot runs Claude Code as a subprocess in your chosen working directory. Claude Code reads all its standard configuration files from that directory, exactly as it would when running directly in a terminal:

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions and context
- `.claude/settings.json` - Permissions and tool settings
- `.claude/commands/` - Custom slash commands
- `.mcp.json` - MCP server configurations

This means you get the full power of Claude Code - including file access, code execution, and any configured MCP tools - all accessible through Telegram.

For complete documentation on Claude Code configuration, see the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed and authenticated.
- A Telegram bot token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)). See [Creating a Telegram Bot](#creating-a-telegram-bot) for instructions.
- **ffmpeg** (required for voice messages) - install with `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS

## Creating a Telegram Bot

To create a new Telegram bot and get your bot token:

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Choose a **display name** for your bot (e.g., "My Claude Assistant")
4. Choose a **username** - must be unique and end with `bot` (e.g., `my_claude_assistant_bot`). The length of the username must be between 5 and 32 characters.
5. BotFather will reply with your bot token (looks like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)
6. Copy this token to your `tact.config.json`

For detailed instructions, see the [Telegram Bot API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot).

## Finding Your Telegram User ID

To find your Telegram user ID:

1. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
2. It will reply with your user ID
3. Add this ID to `allowedUserIds` in your config

## Voice Messages

Voice messages are transcribed locally using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) via the `nodejs-whisper` package. No audio data is sent to external services.

### Prerequisites for Voice Messages

Voice transcription requires additional setup:

1. **ffmpeg** - For audio conversion
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ffmpeg

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install ffmpeg
   ```

2. **CMake** - For building the Whisper executable
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install cmake

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install cmake
   ```

3. **Download and build Whisper** - Run this once after installation:
   ```bash
   npx nodejs-whisper download
   ```
   This downloads the Whisper model and compiles the `whisper-cli` executable. The build process takes a few minutes.

### Whisper Models

| Model            | Size    | Speed    | Quality                        |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `tiny`           | ~75 MB  | Fastest  | Basic quality                  |
| `tiny.en`        | ~75 MB  | Fastest  | English-only, slightly better  |
| `base`           | ~142 MB | Fast     | Good for clear speech          |
| `base.en`        | ~142 MB | Fast     | English-only (default)         |
| `small`          | ~466 MB | Medium   | Good multilingual              |
| `small.en`       | ~466 MB | Medium   | English-only                   |
| `medium`         | ~1.5 GB | Slower   | Very good multilingual         |
| `medium.en`      | ~1.5 GB | Slower   | English-only                   |
| `large-v1`       | ~2.9 GB | Slowest  | Best quality (v1)              |
| `large`          | ~2.9 GB | Slowest  | Best quality (v2)              |
| `large-v3-turbo` | ~1.5 GB | Fast     | Near-large quality, faster     |

**First run**: The selected model will be downloaded automatically. Subsequent runs use the cached model.

### Supported Languages

Whisper supports 50+ languages including English, German, Spanish, French, and many more. Use models without `.en` suffix for multilingual support.

## Sending Files to User

Claude can send files back to you through Telegram. Each user has a dedicated `downloads/` folder, and Claude is informed of this path in every prompt.

### How It Works

1. **Claude writes a file** to your downloads folder (e.g., `.tact/users/{userId}/downloads/report.pdf`)
2. **The bot detects** the new file after Claude's response completes
3. **The file is sent** to you via Telegram (as a document)
4. **The file is deleted** from the server after successful delivery

### Example Usage

Ask Claude to create and send you a file:

```
Create a simple hello.txt file in my downloads folder with "Hello World" content
```

Claude will write the file to your downloads path, and the bot will automatically send it to you.

### Supported Files

Any file type that Telegram supports can be sent, including:
- Documents (PDF, TXT, CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Images (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- Archives (ZIP, TAR, etc.)

## Security Notice

**Important**: Conversations with this bot are not end-to-end encrypted. Messages pass through Telegram's servers and are processed by the Claude API. Do not share sensitive information such as:

- Passwords or API keys
- Personal identification numbers
- Financial information
- Confidential business data
- Any other private or sensitive data

This bot is intended for development assistance and general queries only. Treat all conversations as potentially visible to third parties.
